          <h3> #1 Toothpaste on Glass/Clothes</h3>
          <p>Use a cotton or soft wool cloth with a little non-abrasive toothpaste to quickly brush away scratches on eye glasses. Rub the lens gently, moving the cloth in small circles. Continue this motion for around ten seconds. Rinse with cold water and wipe dry. You'll find out everything around you gets clear again! </p>

          <h3> #2 Use Tennis Balls to Get Rid of a Tension Headache</h3>
          <p> Hold two tennis balls in your hands and hold them behind your head. Lay down with your head on the tennis balls, and slowly roll your head back and forth. This will provide immediate relief from a tension headache. This can also be helpful to relieve stress when middle schoolers sometimes get too stressful at certain things.</p>

          <p>Struggling to wake up for school at 6 a.m? Stick your phone in an empty cup next to your bed. When the alarm goes off, it’ll be much louder, plus you’ll have to use extra brain power to get it out of the cup and turn it off.</p>

          <h3> #5 Organizing Your Notebooks/Notes</h3>
          <p>Have a bunch of notebooks that all look the same? Color the page ends of each book with a different colored sketch pen. This will help you easily recognize the different subject books in your bag or on the shelf and will also bring a great pop of color to your study space! Take notes using different colored pens. Not only will it nicely organise your notes and make them look attractive, it will also help you recall the content easily. However, if you’re not into colored pens and prefer writing in one color only, studies show that notes in blue ink are easier to remember than those in black ink!</p>

          <h3>#6 Smelly Shoes</h3>
          <p>The key to combatting smelly shoes is… tea bags! After playing your favorite sport or walking all day, the best and probably the most eco-friendly way to fix your smelly shoes is to take two tea bags, and put them in your shoes before you put your shoes away. You can also put a handful of aromatic flowers and spices. Your bag, locker, or shoe cabinet will never smell again so try it out! </p>

          <p> It can be really annoying having to untangle your cables before you sit down to do work. Paperclips are cheap and really easy to get hold of, and you should totally have some anyway to keep all those assignments in order! You can hook up all your cables and live a tangle-free life. </p>

          <h3> #8 Clean a Foggy Mirror with Shaving Cream.</h3>
          <p> If you apply traditional shaving cream to your mirror and wipe it down with a paper towel, not only will you rid the mirror of smudges and streaks, but it’ll also keep it from fogging up during a shower for a few weeks. This trick is also useful for cleaning your glasses and car windows. </p>

          <h3> #9 Ice Cube in Dryer</h3>
          <p>Ditch the iron or handheld steamer and just grab some ice if you want to get wrinkles out of a shirt. Put two or three ice cubes in the dryer along with one or two pieces of clothing and place it on the hottest setting. The ice melts and turns to steam, getting the wrinkles out. This trick isn’t as effective with heavier clothing, but it’s a miracle on lighter fabrics. The best part is that you don’t have to set the dryer for longer than 10 minutes or so for it to work</p>

          <h3> #10 Pick Up Broken Glass with Bread</h3>
          <p>When you accidentally drop a glass and hear it shatter on the floor, you know you’ve got to get into action to ensure you get every last piece. Picking up the big pieces is easy enough, the small ones can really be a pain. Put a little bit of water on a piece of bread to make it a bit damp and press it on the floor where the remaining fragments are. The glass will embed in the bread without the danger of cutting your fingers or feet in the process. It’s much easier than trying to sweep up every last fragment, and you’ll likely be able to catch those tiny bits that are otherwise invisible to the naked eye.</p>

Actually, my full name is Yi-tang Gwendolyn Chen, but most of my friends just call me Gwendolyn or just Gwen.  This is our website about life hacks.  We decided to write about life hacks because we love to watch 5-minute crafts and other life hack websites as well, so we thought a website about them would be pretty fun!  I coded the home page, and Hina coded the subpages.  We both spent a lot of time on the coding, so please appreciate our website.  Thanks!
